## Resources Used

A special thanks to Grow With Google program coach Jason Michael White for assistance via Slack getting the markers to animate when list item is clicked.

In addition, the following resources were used.

For FourSquare set-up, [I used Build a Places App with Foursquare tutorial](https://medium.com/the-web-tub/build-a-places-app-with-foursquare-and-google-maps-using-onsen-ui-and-angularjs-df44357cbe3e) and FourSquare's own [developer tutorials](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api). In addition, I consulted with Slack to better understand how to create a responsive list using Foursquare details.

For Google Maps set-up, I consulted [How to Write a Google Maps React Component](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/how-to-write-a-google-maps-react-component/).

To understand Error Boundaries and how to  use them, I followed React's Error Boundaries [tutorial.](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html)

Finally, to handle async functionality, a fellow student on Slack pointed me to the direction of [Making Google Maps work with React](https://www.klaasnotfound.com/2016/11/06/making-google-maps-work-with-react/) tutorial.
